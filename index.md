## For Travelers & Refugees

Here’s what to know if you are denied entry to the United States:

  * Know your rights at the airport, and when detained (American Civil Liberties Union).
  * DO NOT SIGN anything you are asked to sign, including and especially Form I-407.
  * Do not voluntarily abandon your green card or lawful permanent resident application.
  * → Instead, ask for a lawyer.
  * Find housing:
    * Americans are offering sanctuary to those in need.
